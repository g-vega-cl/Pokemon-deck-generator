# Pokemon-deck-generator
 We only expect this project to run on your local machine. 

For this assessment, we would like you to build a deck generator of pokemon cards. In this assessment, please consider these rules for what a "complete" deck is:
A deck should contain exactly 60 cards
12-16 pokemon of a given type
10 energy cards for that type
The rest of the cards should be random trainer cards where no more than 4 cards of the same kind can be repeated

For the type of pokemon and energy, a list of valid types can be found here. 

*Requirements for the front-end*
* Needs to be completed with ReactJS
* A deck list page with a complete list of all previously generated decks, with links to pages containing deck details, and the ability to filter the deck list by pokemon type
* A deck details page containing a list of all the cards in the deck, with their names, images and other properties
* A form page for generating new decks

*Requirements for the backend*
* We use Rails and Ruby but you can complete this with any backend language you feel like, bonus point if you donâ€™t use Javascript
* Data should be stored in a relational database (either MySQL or Postgres)

The pokemon API to use is this one
